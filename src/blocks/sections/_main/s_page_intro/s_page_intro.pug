          .s-page-intro__introtext The authors of the project consciously sought to move away from the British educational model that dominates Moscow's international schools and drew inspiration from the French and Swiss approach, while preserving the values of Russian classical culture and education. The founders gave the children's academy a gloss of exceptional service and a truly individual approach - La Berezka values the individuality of each child, encourages self-expression and emotional development.
