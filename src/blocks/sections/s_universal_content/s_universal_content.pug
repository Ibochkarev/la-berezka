            p Our Art Atelier is much more than just a place for artistic expression, it's a veritable journey through the great works of the classical painters who gave rise to the greatest movements in the history of painting. However, we also explore various types of art, from sculptures to art installations, photography and much more. Our aim is to enable our students to develop a holistic understanding of art in all its forms. Beyond artistic practice, our workshop also aims to cultivate our students' aesthetic intelligence. This means they learn to appreciate art, analyze and interpret works, understand artists' aesthetic choices and develop their own artistic sensibility.
